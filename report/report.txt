\begin{abstract}
I proposed a low order model to describe the carbon dioxide flux in the equatorial Pacific in 
response to the El Nino Southern Oscillation. The model assumes one contribution due to the 
temperature of the water and the
wind speed at the surface of the ocean, and a second contribution due to water from the deep ocean 
being drawn up to the surface. Using this approach combined with a dynamical model, I was able to 
construct a solution which agrees well with observation on the magnitude of the flux, the 
difference in flux between the east and the west of the ocean and the inter-annual variation in 
flux. The model is not however able to capture the North, South variation in flux  in this area of 
the ocean, probably as we have ignored advective currents.

\section{Introduction}

In this project, I aim to construct a simple model to describe the flux of carbon dioxide between 
the ocean and the atmosphere in the equatorial Pacific. In particular we would like to understand 
how the $\text{CO}_2$ flux is affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (hereafter ENSO). 

An El Nino event is when there is anomalously warm water in the equatorial Pacific for an extended 
period of time, typically several months. The temperature anomaly is usually strongest in the east 
or the centre of the Pacific basin. The corresponding event with colder than average water is named 
  La Nina. ENSO is the term given to the irregular cycle of El Nino and La Nina event, and 
has a time period of between 2 and 7 years. (reference) 

To understand why ENSO occurs, we put forward an idealised model of the processes which 
dominate the dynamics in the equatorial Pacific.

Throughout this report, we consider the ocean to be a two layer ocean. This is a simple model in 
which we describe the ocean as having two distinct layers, an upper, mixed layer, and a lower, deep 
ocean. For a given point in space and time, each layer is considered to constant properties over 
its entire depth. Only the mixed layer is able to interact with the atmosphere, and the properties 
of the deep ocean change only very slowly. On the time period of interest (the time 
period of ENSO of a few years) we take the properties of the deep  ocean to be constant. (This 
approach is frequently used in the equatorial Pacific, for example in papers such as (reference).

Under normal conditions, (neither El Nino nor La Nina) the easterly trade winds create a mean 
westerly flow in the water at the surface of the ocean. In the east of the basin, this causes water 
from the deep ocean to be drawn to the surface to replace the water moving to the west. We shall 
call this process of deep ocean water being drawn up to the surface as upwelling. This upwelled 
water is much cooler, resulting in a cooler sea surface temperature (hereafter SST) in the east 
of the basin than in the west. We can see the effect of this upwelled water by looking at the depth 
of the thermocline along the equator. The thermocline is a thin layer in the ocean where the 
temperature of the water changes very rapidly with depth. In a two layer ocean, this corresponds 
the surface which marks the boundary between the mixed layer and the deep ocean. Figure() shows 
that under normal conditions, the thermocline is much shallower in the East of the basin than in 
the West. We can also see that the during an El Nino event, the profile of the thermocline is much 
flatter, and is much deeper than before in the East, and so is linked to warmer than average SST 
here. The reverse is true during a La Nina event, with a steeper profile indicating more upwelling 
in the East and so lower than average SST.

conditions), the depth during the El Nino event of 1998, and the depth during the La Nina event of 
1999. We can clearly see that during the El Nino event, the thermocline is much flatter. Data from 
(reference).}
\label{iso_depth_along_equator}
\end{figure}

If we perturb the system away from this mean state, for example by creating a positive SST anomaly 
in the centre of the Pacific, then we weaken the easterly trade winds (the Bjerkness hypothesis 
(reference)). We expect that this will reduce the amount of water being upwelled in the East, and 
indeed it does excite a downwelling wave in the thermocline which will travel towards the East in 
the form of an equatorial Kelvin wave. At the same time, a westwards moving upwelling Rossby wave 
is created. We now have an El Nino event, with the thermocline deeper than normal in the East, and 
shallower than normal in the West. Eventually, the westwards moving Rossby waves will reach the 
western edge of the Pacific, and will be reflected as upwelling Kelvin waves which cancel the 
downwelling Kelvin waves and end the event. (Further knowledge ofKelvin and Rossby waves is not 
required here, except that they propagate with different, well known speeds). 

ENSO is the largest observed source of variation in inter annual global SST, and as a result of 
this, we expect it to also have a large impact on the variability of the $\text{CO}_2$ flux between 
the ocean 
and the atmosphere. Understanding ENSO, and how it affects the exchange of $\text{CO}_2$ is 
therefore an 
important step in understanding how $\text{CO}_2$ is stored in the ocean. However, ENSO has proved 
to be a 
feature that is very difficult to model accurately, with the current climate models struggling to 
reproduce the correct combination of amplitude, location and power spectrum of ENSO. As a result, 
predictions of the carbon flux in this region are generally unreliable. Furthermore, due to the 
complex, numerical nature of these models, it is often difficult to gain any physical insight into 
the processes occurring. 

In light of this, we would like to step back from these complex models, and instead attempt to buld 
a low order, physically intuitive model of how the carbon flux varies during ENSO. The main goals 
of this project are therefore to create a model which is as simple as possible while still 
capturing the main effects, gives an answer which is easy to interpret physically, and is driven by 
observational data. 

\section{Experimental Method}

In constructing our model, we assume that the two factors which have largest effect on the 
carbon flux in this region are the surface temperature of the water, and the rate of upwelling. 
Two notable factors that we have chosen to ignore in simplifying the system are the biological life 
  in the ocean and the horizontal advective currents. We also assume that it is possible to treat 
the flux due to the temperature of the water and the flux due to the upwelling as independent 
effects. 

\subsection{Flux due to SST}

We expect the SST to have an effect on the amount of flux observed as both the solubility of a gas 
in water and the partial pressure of the gas depend on the temperature of the water. As the water 
heats up, the solubility decreases, the partial pressure increases, and so we expect a more 
positive flux at higher temperatures. (reference)?????

We can intuitively expect that the flux of carbon dioxide out of the water will be proportional to 
the difference in concentration of $\text{CO}_2$ between the ocean and the atmosphere. We can 
therefore write

\begin{equation}
F_{SST} = k \cdot \Delta [CO_2].
\end{equation}

The constant of proportionality here is the gas transfer velocity, and is typically take to be a 
function of the wind speed at the surface of the ocean only. We use the form suggested in 
(reference) of;

\begin{equation}
k(v) = 87.6 \cdot (0.31v^2 - 0.71v + 7.76).
\end{equation}

It is convenient to present the flux in units of $mol \cdot m^{-2} \cdot yr^{-1}$, requiring k in 
units of $m \cdot hour^{-1}$ and $\Delta [CO_2]$ in $mol \cdot m^{-3}$. The factor of 87.6 in (2) 
is due to a unit conversion from $cm \cdot hour^{-1}$. From here, we shall use Henry's constant 
$H(T)$ which relates for a given temperature, the concentration of gas in a liquid to its partial 
pressure via

\begin{equation}
H(T) = \frac{[CO_2]}{pCO_2}.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure} [ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=85mm]{figures/solubility_co2_water.png}
\caption{The solubility of carbon dioxide in water as a function of temperature. Image from 
(reference)}
\label{solubility_co2_water}
\end{figure}

$H(T)$ is a constant for a given temperature, so we can obtain a value for it by looking at a 
simple system with still water and gaseous $\text{CO}_2$ at a pressure of one atmosphere above it. 
The 
partial pressure is then one atmosphere (approximately the atmospheric pressure P) and the 
concentration of $\text{CO}_2$ in the water is then simply the solubility of the water at this 
temperature. 
The solubility of $\text{CO}_2$ in water is shown in Figure 2. We approximate the solubility in 
this 
temperature range as;

\begin{equation}
S(t) = \frac{1000}{44} \cdot (22.4 - 0.07T),
\end{equation}

where the numerical pre-factor is a unit conversion from $g \cdot kg^{-1}$ into $mol \cdot m^{-3}$ 
assuming a constant density of water of 1000 $kg m^{-3}$.

From this we obtain

\begin{equation}
H(T) = \frac {1000 \cdot (22.4 - 0.07)}{44 \cdot P}.
\end{equation}

Using Henry's constant, we can now write (1) as

\begin{equation}
F_{SST} = H(T)k(v) \lbrace pCO_2^{ocean} - pCO_2^{air} \rbrace,
\end{equation}

where $pCO_2$ is the partial pressure of $\text{CO}_2$. We are now able to use the results of 
(reference) to 
parametrise the $pCO_2$ as

\begin{equation}
pCO_2^{ocean} = A e^{0.0423T},
\end{equation}

where A is a parameter to be chosen later. 

Finally, assuming a constant mole fraction of $\text{CO}_2$ in the atmosphere, $f$, gives

\begin{equation}
pCO_2^{air} = fP,
\end{equation}

where $P$ here is the atmospheric pressure. 

This allows us to write the following equation for the flux due to the SST in terms of variables 
for which there is a large quantity of data. 

(perhaps mention the data to get all this in terms of earlier than now!)

\subsection{Flux due to Upwelling}

We expect the upwelling to have an effect on the $\text{CO}_2$ flux because the deep water is far 
cooler 
and richer in $\text{CO}_2$ than the water in the mixed layer (reference). As this water is brought 
to the 
surface, it warms up, and releases some of the $\text{CO}_2$ contained within it. 

We can quickly estimate the amount of $\text{CO}_2$ released per unit area in this process as being 
equal to 
the amount of carbon dioxide released per unit volume multiplied by the upwelling velocity, $w$. We 
calculate the amount of carbon released per unit volume as the change in the concentration of 
$\text{CO}_2$. 

As before, we estimate the concentration as $[CO_2] = H \cdot pCO_2^{air}$ giving us

\begin{equation}
[CO_2] = \frac{f \cdot 1000 \cdot (22.4 - 0.07T)}{44},
\end{equation}

which suggests a change in concentration of

\begin{equation}
\Delta [CO_2] = \frac{70 \cdot f \cdot \Delta T}{44},
\end{equation}

where $\Delta T$ is a parameter representing the change in temperature experienced by the water as 
it rises. 

Finally, this results in a flux due to an upwelling velocity of $w$ of

\begin{equation}
F_{upwelling} = \frac{70 \cdot f \cdot \Delta T}{44}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Whole Model}

Combining these two contributions, we obtain the following equation which will serve as the basis 
for all of the calculations in this paper;

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
F_{total} & = F_{SST} + F_{upwelling} \\
    & = H k \cdot \lbrace A e^{\alpha T} - fP \rbrace + \frac{70f \Delta T w}{44}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Estimation of Upwelling Rate}

Equation (13) serves as a clear and physically intuitive description of the effects that we will be 
considering, however, this form of the equation is difficult to use in practice as the upwelling 
rate $w$ is very small and is almost never measured, and modelled only rarely. This lack of data 
makes it necessary for us to construct a simple model t approximate the value of $w$ from variables 
for which data is more available. 

We are interested in effects on or very close to the equator, and therefore are considering points 
which are at almost the sane latitude. Additionally, near the equator we cn assume that currents 
will predominantly run along the equator rather than across it. These two factors lead us to 
approximate that if there was no upwelling anywhere else in the basin, we would expect to see vey 
similar temperature profile at any point in the basin This is not what is observed, and so we make 
the approximation that the deviations are due to upwelling cold water. A useful variable for us to 
use here is the heat content of the water per unit area (calculated as an integral of the heat 
content over the top 300m of the ocean). From  our model of the dynamics in the Pacific basin, we 
expect to see very little upwelling in the west of the basin, and so we assume that the  heat 
content here is what we would expect to find in the absence of upwelling. This will be our 
reference heat content ($Heat_{reference}$). At all other points, we can then calculate a heat 
difference, finding that the heat content is lower in the east of the basin. Using our model of a 
two layer ocean, we can then work out the volume of deep ocean water needed in order to explain the 
heat difference. 

\begin{figure} [ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=85mm]{figures/solubility_co2_water.png}
\caption{Left, an idealsied model of the west of the basin, where there is no upwelling. Right, I 
approximate the difference in the heat content as being due to an extra depth of cold water $x$.}
\label{upwelling_model_diagram}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Heat_{ref} = & \rho c d T_{hot} + \rho c (D - d)T_{cold}\\
Heat_{actual} = & \rho c (d-x)T_{hot} + \rho c (D-d+x)T_{cold}\\
\Delta Heat = & Heat_{ref} - Heat_{actual}\\
    = & mcx \Delta T
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the density of water, $c$, is the specific heat capacity of water, and we have 
defined $\Delta T = T_{hot} - T_{cold}$.

We now rearrange to find the cold water volume $V_{coldwater}$.

\begin{equation}
V_{coldwater} = \frac{\Delta Heat}{\rho c \Delta T}
\end{equation}

Finally, we now introduce a parameter, $R$, the replenishment rate, which represents the frequency 
with which the cold water volume is replaced. 

From this, we calculate the upwelling rate, $w$, as;

\begin{equation}
w = \frac{R \cdot \Delta Heat}{\rho c \Delta T}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Fitting Model Parameters to Data}

Let us summarise our progress so far;

\begin{equation}
F_{total} = Hk \cdot \lbrace Ae^{0.0423T} - fP \rbrace + \frac{70fR \Delta Heat}{44\rho c}
\end{equation}

We must now estimate the values for the model parameters.

\begin{itemize}

\item{$f$:} This is the mole fraction of $\text{CO}_2$ in the atmosphere. We assume that this is a 
constant, 
and has a value of $3.8 \times 10^4$ (atmospheric concentration of $\text{CO}_2$ is about 380ppm).

\item{$Heat_{ref}$:} This is the heat content that we expect to find with no upwelling. We pick a 
region in the west of the basin as our reference point, (0N, 156E). We also allow for a seasonal 
cycle, and o the reference value used will be the average for that month of the year. 

\item{$A$:} This is chosen by picking a temperature and pressure for which the carbon flux due to 
SST is zero. By looking at Figure 7, we choose a region in the west of the equatorial Pacific as 
our zero point, and  by looking at mean SST and surface pressure in this region, obtained a value 
of $1.085 \times 10^{-4}$.

\item{$R$:} As there is no precise data for the upwelling velocity, this was chosen to be 400 by 
tuning the model to best fit the observed flux. The corresponding value for $w$ is peaking at about 
$5 \times 10^{-4}$ (assuming a $\Delta T$ of $5K$) which is a sensible value.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effect of ENSO on Carbon Flux}

We now wish to use this model model to calculate how the carbon flux varies with time during ENSO. 
In order to do this, we need to relate the variables used in equation () to some parameter 
representing the strength of ENSO at that time. For our purposes, we choose the thermocline depth 
as our ENSO parameter, (reference) as there is a large amount of data for this, and it is a  common 
diagnostic to describe ENSO. It is a common practice (change wording here) to characterise 
all variables in terms of thermocline depth, (reference or change) and is convenient for us 
to take this approach.

For this paper, I use data taken from (reference). The TAO data is gathered from a 
system of buoys in the Pacific which cover a region from 8N to 8S, and from 137E to 110W. These 
buys gather data daily, and records go back to about 1960, although  gaps in the data are frequent, 
especially early in the time series. The data set does not include data for the thermocline depth 
as such, but does include data for the 20C isotherm depth, which we expect to be a surface within 
the thin thermocline lyer, so we shall use this as a substitute. Due to the frequent gaps in the 
data, I first convert the data to a monthly mean, thus reducing the impact of individual missing 
days or weeks. I then calculate a mean value for each of the variables used (SST, heat content, 
surface air pressure, surface wind speed and 20C isotherm depth). It is important for us to be able 
to separate the effect of ENSO from the effect of the annual cycle, so we calculate a separate mean 
for each month of the year. From this, we are able to obtain a time series of the anomaly in each 
of the variables, calculated by subtracting the expected value for that month from the actual value 
recorded. We then make a scatter plot of the anomaly in each of these variables against the 20C 
isotherm depth anomaly. From this, we calculate the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient 
and a line of best fit. The results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 4.

\begin{figure} [ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=85mm]{figures/scatter_plot_SST_vs_isotherm.png}
\caption{The solubility of carbon dioxide in water as a function of temperature. Image from 
(reference)}
\label{scatter_plot_SST_vs_isotherm}
\end{figure}

We found a strong correlation between the SST and the isotherm depth, and an even better 
correlation between the heat content and the isotherm depth. The correlations with pressure and 
wind speed were much weaker, but were still considered good enough for us to gain a rough 
parametrisation of them from the line of best fit and the monthly mean. 

This gives us a method of estimating a carbon flux using the thermocline depth as the only 
parameter.

\subsection{A Simple Model of ENSO}

We now wish to demonstrate our ability to generate a prediction of the carbon flux based on a 
dynamical model 
of ENSO. In this case, we shall use the simple model of ENSO proposed in (reference). This model is 
excellent for our purposes as it is one of the simplest which still exhibits the low order chaotic 
behaviour that we observe, has a time period which approximately agrees with observation, and shows 
seasonal locking. It also characterises ENSO in terms of the thermocline depth alone. 

The model is based around the idea of a delayed oscillator. This uses the description of ENSO that 
we put forward in the introduction, where we have an eastwards propagating Kelvin wave, which 
reaches the east of the basin a time $\tau_1$ after being created. At this point,the coupling 
between the ocean and the atmosphere allows for this wave to have an impact on the centre of the 
basin via the wind. Along with the Kelvin wave, a westwards propagating Rossby wave is also 
created, and this is reflected off the western boundary of the basin and then travels eastwards as 
a Kelvin wave. This wave eventually reaches the East of the basin at a time $\tau_2$ at which point 
it also has an effect on the anomaly at the centre of the basin. 

By adding a seasonal cycle to this concept, we can construct a simple equation for the rate of 
change of thermocline depth;

\begin{equation}
\frac{dh}{dt} = a A[h(t-\tau_1)] - bA[h(t-\tau_2)] + c \cdot \cos (\omega t)
\end{equation}

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are parameters, and $A[h]$ is a function defining the coupling between the 
ocean and the atmosphere. 

$\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ can be easily calculated as the time taken for the waves to propagate the 
required distance;

\begin{equation}
\tau_1 = \frac{L}{2C_{Kelvin}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\tau_2 = \frac{L}{2C_{Rossby}} + \frac{L}{C_{Kelvin}}
\end{equation}

Here, $L$ is the width of the Pacific basin, and $C_{Kelvin}$ and $C_{Rossby}$ are the speeds of 
the Kelvin and Rossby waves respectively. 

We use the form suggested of $A$ in (reference) of;

\begin{equation}
look up how to do this again!!!
\end{equation}

\begin{figure} [ht]

\label{correlation_map}
\end{figure}

The predicted for of ENSO varies greatly depending on the choice of parameters. For a full 
discussion of how the parameters affect the model, see (reference) and (reference), for our 
purposes, we shall choose the parameters to be as in (reference) with $\kappa = 2.0$. This choice 
of parameters gives us the best possible mix of period of oscillation, seasonal locking, and 
chaotic behaviour. Figure 6 shows a plot of the time series of this model against the observed 
data.

\label{isotherm_anomaly_model}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}

We start by presenting the observed flux in Figure 7. We shall use this to evaluate the success of 
our model. In Figure 8 we present a plot of the model time averaged carbon flux over the whole of 
the basin. These plots have been created using Equation 17 with observation data from (reference) 
to create a carbon flux map for each month since 1979. We not that while there was sufficient data 
for SST, heat content, isotherm depth and wind speed, the data for pressure does not exist for many 
of the grid points. In order to preserve enough data points, we have made the assumption that 
pressure is a constant in time and space. This is not a terrible assumption as the variance in the 
surface pressure is 
small and so $\Delta pCO_2$ is dominated by the $pCO_2^{ocean}$ term. We set this constant to be 
101kPa. The time average is calculated for each grid point as a mean of all of the months for which 
there is data. In all of the plots shown, we have defined a positive value to refer to a flux of 
carbon dioxide out of the ocean.

\begin{figure} [ht]

\caption{A comparison of the observed carbon flux and the carbon flux given by the model.}
\label{zoomed_time_averaged_flux}
\end{figure}

We can immediately see that we predict a much larger flux than expected in the North of the basin, 
but in the South of the basin, our prediction matches the observational data well. Figure 9 
illustrates this by plotting the time averaged carbon flux along a slice through the data at a 
latitude of 4S, where the data suggests that the effect of ENSO is large.

\begin{figure} [ht]

\caption{A comparison of the carbon flux across the basin at 4S shown in the data and predicted by 
the model.}
\label{flux_at_one_latitude}
\end{figure}

We next wish to examine how the carbon flux varies with time. To do this, we pick a single grid 
point, in our case (0N, 110W), and plot the time series of the flux at that point. We have chosen 
this grid point because we showed stronger correlations between the variables in the east of the 
basin than in the west, and so believe that many of our assumptions will be most reliable in this 
region. It is also a grid point in which the data is amongst the most complete, and allows for 
comparison with the model, which is only valid for a point in the east of the basin. Figure 10 
shows the plots for the carbon flux as a function of time. 

\begin{figure} [ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=85mm]{figures/carbon_flux.png}
\caption{The carbon flux predicted by the model.}
\label{carbon_flux}
\end{figure}

We can also compare how to flux varies in different parts of the basin. Figure 11 compares the flux 
in the west of the basin to the flux in the east of the basin. Finally, we wish to show that we are 
able to make a prediction of the carbon flux based on a model of how the thermocline depth evolves 
with time. In order to do this, we have parametrised all variables in terms of the isotherm depth. 
We here assess the validity of this method by plotting a comparison between the historical flux 
based on all of the data and a plot based only on the historic isotherm depth. 

\begin{figure} [ht]

\caption{A comparison of the carbon flux in the east and west of the basin.}
\label{carbon_flux_east_vs_west}
\end{figure}

We note the the variability in the parametrised model is much lower than in the unparametrised 
version, but  that the mean values and the shape of the plots are similar. Proceeding with this 
method, we are now able to plot the predicted carbon flux based on the model of the thermocline 
anomaly. We have scaled the thermocline anomaly by a factor of 50 so that the magnitude of the 
fluctuations are in line with the observed values. Figure 12 shows the result of this.

\end{figure}

\section{Analysis}

In Figures 10 and 13, we see that our total flux in the East is comprised of a strongly positive 
flux due to the upwelling, and a slightly negative flux due to the SST. We also note that in 
general, the anomaly in $F_{SST}$ has the opposite sign to the anomaly in $F_{upwelling}$. This 
makes sense, as an increase in upwelling results in a decrease in the SST, however, it has an 
interesting effect on the inter-annual variation of the flux when comparing the parametrised and 
unparametrised variables (Figure 12). With this parametrised variables, the signs of $F_{SST}$  and 
$F_{upwelling}$ are always opposite, and so there is always a significant cancellation between 
them, making the variation in total flux smaller than the variation in either component. This is 
not true as much in the unparametrised version, where while the signs often opposed, this is not 
always the case, and the form of the components are not identical. The allows for a much larger 
variation in the flux. 

When we compare the inter-annual variability in the $\text{CO}_2$ flux that we obtain from our model 
with 
observation, (reference) we find that our variation in the East of the basin roughly agrees with 
observation, both with a value of about 1 $mol m^{-2} yr^{-1}$, but our variability in the West of 
the basin does not drop off as it does in the observed data. This could be due to the fact that 
the thermocline is so much deeper in this section of the ocean. This extra depth will mean that the 
properties of this region will be much slower to change, and could damp the effect of ENSO more 
than suggested in the model. 

From Figure 9, we can see that the model captures the East, West pattern very well. Both the 
magnitude of the flux and the variation of the flux between the east and west of the ocean agree 
quite well with observation. This suggests that the proposed model is succeeding in capturing much 
of the observed behaviour and is an encouraging result. However, our model shows significant 
North-South gradient which does not agree with the data. A possible explanation of this is the 
ocean currents. Our weakest assumption appears to be in our estimation of the upwelling velocity, 
where we have had to attribute all of difference in heat to upwelling. In the North-East of the 
basin, this is not the case, as there is the additional effect of cooler water being brought down 
from North of the equator (Figure 14). As a result of this, the water in this region is cooler than 
elsewhere, and we have over estimated the upwelling rate, giving us the false result. In favour of 
this explanation, as about 4S, where Figure 14 indicates that the approximation of a purely 
westwards flow is best, we obtain the results which best match observation.

Another effect that we have ignored in this model is that of biology. We would expect that this 
would have the effect of decreasing the carbon flux, as the biological life has the net effect of 
absorbing $\text{CO}_2$ (reference) and carrying it down to the deep ocean when it dies. The impact 
of 
ignoring this effect is not as obvious in our results, and this is possibly because the amount of 
biological life is also correlated to the upwelling rate. This is because as well as being rich in 
$\text{CO}_2$, the deep ocean is also rich in other nutrients that help to sustain life. To a first 
approximation, it may well be reasonable to approximate the contribution from biology as being 
equal to $const + K_{bio}w$. If this is the case, then the impact of biology would only be to 
change the values of the parameters used. The $const$ term would effect the value of $A$, and the 
$K_{bio}$ would effect the value of $R$. This would suggest that our values for both $F_{SST}$ and 
$F_{upwelling}$ are slightly too low, and would be difficult to observe in the data. Alternately, 
the effect of biology could simply be very small in comparison to the other factors. 

\section{Conclusion}

I have shown that it is possible to reproduce many of the features seen in the air-sea carbon 
dioxide flux in the equatorial Pacific by considering only the flux due to the temperature of the 
water and the flux due to the upwelling of water from the deep ocean. In particular, the model is 
able to produce a profile of the carbon flux along a given latitude which agrees well with 
observation. This result is especially strong for a latitude just south of the equator. 

I was also to produce an estimate of the carbon flux based on a dynamical model of the thermocline 
depth. In order to achieve this, all of the variables are parametrised in terms of the thermocline 
depth. This approach is only valid in the east of the basin, where the correlations between the 
anomaly in thermocline depth is best correlated with the anomaly in the other variables, but we 
were able to show that within this limit, the approximation works well. One disadvantage of this 
method however, is that the inter-annual variation in the carbon flux is lower than when the raw 
data is used for all of the variables. 

These successes suggest that the complex dynamics in the equatorial Pacific can be well represented 
by a process based, low order model. However, there are some features in the data which are not 
well represented by this model. Most notably, the model shows a clear north-south gradient in the 
carbon flux, which disagrees with observation. A possible explanation of this is that in the 
north-east of the basin, a current of cold water from the north is reducing the temperature of the 
water. In our model we have assumed that any cooling is due to upwelling, and so by ignoring this 
current, we have overestimated the amount of  upwelling, and so overestimated the carbon flux. 

The susceptibility of the model to ocean currents highlights that this model is likely only to be 
applicable in the equatorial Pacific. In addition to this, in other areas of the ocean there may be 
other dynamical effects which are not taken account of here. For example in many areas of the 
ocean, such as (place), there is  downwelling water, which we are unable to model. 

In this project, I have shown that a low order linear model captures enough of the dynamics in the 
equatorial Pacific to make further investigation interesting. The most obvious cause of 
error appears to be that I have ignored the horizontal advective currents. It would therefore be 
desirable to find a method of parametrising the effects of the currents. However, it is not clear 
how this could be easily achieved. Another factor that could be introduced given more time is the 
effect of biological life in the ocean. As discussed in the Analysis, while this would probably be 
possible given more time, it may not affect the end result significantly. Further, it would be 
interesting to examine the possibility of using this low order model in conjunction with a much 
more complex climate model, either to help analyse the output of the climate model, or to help 
increase the speed of the model by making use of some of the relationships discovered here.
